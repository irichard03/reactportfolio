#React Portfolio
======
by Ian Richard

This is my 2018 Portfolio, thanks UT- Austin coding Bootcamp for kickstarting my exploration into the world of full stack development.

This portolio showcases my progression from possessing a modest understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript to building full stack website applications. My current tech "Stack" portfolio includes:

*HTML | CSS
*Bootstrap | Materialize |
*JavaScript | JQuery
*Firebase | MySQL | MicrosoftSQL
*Node | Express
*React

If you're looking to collaborate on a project using any of these technologies or for a part-time full stack developer please use the contact form on the site. If you want to hang out with other Houston Coders check out our discord at https://discord.gg/XUtxDt2.

Thanks and Gig 'em
